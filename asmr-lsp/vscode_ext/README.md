# Assembl-Really

Assembly code gives end users full control over every aspect of their program. It enables the most sophisticated of memory management and optimization; it lets you wrangle the absolute most out of everything; and best of all, it runs really fast.

Introducing *Assembl-Really*. We guarantee less control over over your program due to a limited instruction set; we don't support every feature expected in most assembly languages; and most importantly, we interpret your code instead of compiling it, sacrificing any speed benefits.

Combining assembly syntax with a lack of all the usual benefits to using assembly: we present *Assembl-Really*!
